\# Week 4 – E-commerce Sales Data Analysis Report



\## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using Python.  

The objective is to load, clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret sales data in order to extract meaningful business insights.



The project follows a structured analytical pipeline:

Data Loading → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Analysis → Visualization → Insights



---



\## 2. Objectives

\- Analyze sales data using Python and Pandas

\- Apply data cleaning and validation techniques

\- Generate multiple types of data visualizations using Matplotlib

\- Interpret visual results to derive business insights

\- Present the analysis in a clear, professional format



---



\## 3. Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional sales data with the following key columns:

\- Date: Transaction date

\- Product: Product name

\- Region: Sales region

\- Quantity: Units sold

\- Price: Price per unit

\- Total\_Sales: Total revenue per transaction

\- Customer\_ID: Unique customer identifier



The dataset represents real-world structured sales data suitable for exploratory and visual analysis.



---



\## 4. Data Cleaning \& Preparation

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

\- Converted `Total\_Sales` column to numeric format

\- Converted `Date` column to datetime format

\- Removed rows with missing or invalid values in critical columns

\- Ensured consistency and reliability before analysis



Feature engineering was applied by extracting:

\- Month (numeric)

\- Month\_Name (readable month name)

\## 5. Data Analysis \& Visualizations



\### 5.1 Total Sales by Product (Bar Chart)

A bar chart was created to compare total sales across different products.



\*\*Insight:\*\*

Certain products contribute significantly more to overall revenue, indicating key revenue drivers for the business.



---



\### 5.2 Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)

A line chart was used to visualize total sales across months.



\*\*Insight:\*\*

Sales fluctuate over time, suggesting seasonality and varying customer demand across different periods.



---



\### 5.3 Sales Distribution by Region (Pie Chart)

A pie chart was used to analyze the percentage contribution of each region to total sales.



\*\*Insight:\*\*

Sales are unevenly distributed across regions, highlighting strong and weak market areas that can guide regional strategy.



---



\## 6. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline using Python.

By combining numerical analysis with visual storytelling, the project provides actionable insights into product performance, seasonal trends, and regional distribution.



The approach reflects real-world data analysis practices and emphasizes clarity, accuracy, and decision-oriented insights.
